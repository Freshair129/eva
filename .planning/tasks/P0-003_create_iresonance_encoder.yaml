# Task: Create IResonanceEncoder Interface
id: P0-003
phase: 0
title: "Create IResonanceEncoder interface"
status: done
priority: high
estimated_lines: 25

# Description
description: |
  Create the IResonanceEncoder interface that defines how
  raw state data is encoded into resonance format (color, intensity).

  RMS will implement this in later phases.
  MockResonanceEncoder will be used in Phase 1.

# Output
output_file: "contracts/ports/i_resonance_encoder.py"

# Specification
spec: |
  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
  from typing import Dict, Any

  class IResonanceEncoder(ABC):
      """
      Port interface for resonance encoding.

      Converts raw system state into resonance-formatted data
      with color mapping, intensity calculation, etc.

      Implementors:
      - MockResonanceEncoder (Phase 1)
      - RMSEngine (Phase 5)
      """

      @abstractmethod
      def encode(self, raw_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          """
          Encodes raw state into resonance format.

          Args:
              raw_state: Raw state from any IStateProvider

          Returns:
              Dict containing:
              - encoded_at: ISO timestamp
              - resonance_color: Hex color string
              - intensity: Float 0.0-1.0
              - raw_hash: Short hash of input
          """
          pass

      @abstractmethod
      def get_encoder_id(self) -> str:
          """Returns unique identifier for this encoder."""
          pass
  ```

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - File exists at contracts/ports/i_resonance_encoder.py
  - Class IResonanceEncoder is defined with ABC
  - Both methods are abstract
  - Type hints are complete
  - Docstrings explain purpose
