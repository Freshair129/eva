## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures a single architectural decision along with its context and consequences.

**Format:** Each ADR follows a standard template:
- **Status:** Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Context:** What is the issue?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Consequences:** What are the trade-offs?
